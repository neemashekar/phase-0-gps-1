*What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*
I had a really hard time figuring out when to use which git commands. I struggled the most with doing local merges from the bash shell but after this session I think I have a much better idea of how that works. 

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*
Creating new branches, switching branches, adding changes, commiting changes, and creating new poll requests were all concepts that became much more clear to me after this session. 

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*
I asked my partner when you would use the command "git pull". 

*What still confuses you about GIT?*
There is a lot of stuff that still confuses me about GIT including how to make local merges like we did in release 5. I also have a hard time navigating GIThub. I do however feel that these questions will get more clear as I use GIT more often. 

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*
It was very rocky at first when we were working with the guide. However because we didn't manage to finish everything when we had time with our guide, we were forced to reschedule. After we reconvened things got a lot more smooth and I was able to get some of my major questions answered.
