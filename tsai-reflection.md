* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I have a hard time with the different attributes to git commands that were cleared up during our session.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The attributes used in `ls` or `git push` were clarified for me.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Many, where do I start?  Some commands I forgot so I had to ask about them.  A few times, we got pull, push, clone confused that had many questions about that.

* What still confuses you about Git?

origin...  why origin

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

We took a lot longer than we both expected.  But, since this was our first, there was a bit of poking around in the dark that was done.  I feel our next GPS will be much smoother.
